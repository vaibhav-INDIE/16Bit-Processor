# 16Bit-Processor
In this we attempted to implement a 16bit processor with Single Bus functionality.

The following are the features:
    
    ADD
  
    SUB
  
    AND - BITWISE
  
    XOR - BITWISE
  
    STORE

All the following components were implemented in the following:

    ALU
  
    DECORDER
  
    PC

    IR 
  
    REGISTORS

The following was implemented in python
